# ValidPalindrome
Do these letters produce a palindrome?
This method is looking for a True or False, indicated by the boolean. You will take in as a parameter a string. Is this string the same word forwards and backwards? If the length is 0, it is true. Nothing is nothing, no matter how you look at it. 
Make an empty variable to store the letters that you will pick off 
from string.
Traverse through the string. Confirm that the string is made of letters. Checking each index of the string, moving from right to left. Compare that last letter to the first index. Are they the same? Yes? Good money, put it in the palindrome variable. Continue with the letters remaining from the string, moving from aft to beginning. If the letters don't match up => False. Otherwise => True.
